I'm Christopher De Vries. I once was an astronomer, earning my Ph.D. at the 
[University of Massachusetts, Amherst](http://www.umass.edu/). I went on to do
postdoctoral work at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) and went on to become a tenured
professor at [California State University
Stanislaus](https://www.csustan.edu/) before giving it all up to become a
reclusive hermit.

I've also helped characterize the debris in low Earth orbit at [NASA Lewis
(now Glenn) Research
Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/home/index.html), I've written
iPhone and iPad apps for Tech 2000 (now [lumious](https://lumious.com)), pushed
back the frontiers of human and machine knowledge for
[Hindsait](https://hindsait.com/), and now I keep the internet running with my
team at [Secunetics](https://www.secunetics.com/).

My professional interests include:

- statistical modeling and analysis
- network security
- systems monitoring and alerting
- programming (mostly [python](https://www.python.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/))

In my spare time I tend to program small
microcontrollers to make lights blink on and off in assorted and
interesting colors. At work I do the same thing, just in higher resolution. I
also have a [web site](https://unnecessary.tech) where I largely forget to post
updates.
